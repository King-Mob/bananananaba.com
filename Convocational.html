                <h3>What if an app was made democratically?</h3>
                <p>Convocational Development is a perspective on making software that treats the users and developers as forming a miniature society.</p>
                <p>Most large software platforms are run like aristocratic kingdoms. The users have no formal power to change the platform itself: their influence is purely reactive.</p>
                <p>I want to build software where users have a signficant say in the direction the development goes in, to the point where the line between a user and a developer starts to blur.</p>
                <p>To do this requires a democratic apparatus, and the building of these apparatuses is what this project is about.</p>
